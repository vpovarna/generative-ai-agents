In Go, you can use the crypto/aes package to encrypt files. The process involves creating a cipher block, choosing a mode (like GCM or CBC), and applying it to your data.","answer":"To encrypt files using AES in Go, you need to: 1) Import crypto/aes and crypto/cipher packages, 2) Generate a 32-byte key, 3) Create an AES cipher block using aes.NewCipher(), 4) Choose a mode like GCM for authenticated encryption, and 5) Apply the cipher to your file data. Here's a basic example that demonstrates the encryption process."}}

They have some performance overhead due to dynamic dispatch and indirect method calls.","answer":"Interfaces are an important feature of Go that enable polymorphism and clean architecture. They allow you to write flexible, testable code by depending on abstractions rather than concrete types."}}

Unbuffered channels block until both sender and receiver are ready. Buffered channels allow sending without immediate receiver, up to the buffer size.","answer":"Unbuffered channels (created with make(chan T)) require both sender and receiver to be ready, providing synchronization. Buffered channels (make(chan T, n)) allow n values to be sent without blocking, useful for producer-consumer patterns. Use unbuffered when you need strict synchronization, and buffered when you want to decouple sender/receiver or handle bursts of data."}}

Both are used in microservices architectures.","answer":"REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange. It's widely adopted and easy to use with standard HTTP clients. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers which are more compact than JSON."}}

User mentioned slow SELECT queries with multiple JOINs.","answer":"To improve your database query performance, consider: 1) Adding indexes on columns used in JOIN and WHERE clauses, 2) Using EXPLAIN to analyze query plans, 3) Reducing the number of JOINs by denormalizing data where appropriate, 4) Implementing query result caching, and 5) Using connection pooling to reduce connection overhead."}}

{"event_id":"evt-rel-009","event_type":"agent_response","agent":{"name":"kg-agent","type":"rag","version":"1.0.0"},"interaction":{"user_query":"Can you explain that in more detail?","context":"Previous conversation discussed Go's garbage collector and its tri-color mark-and-sweep algorithm. User wants more details about the GC algorithm.","answer":"The Go garbage collector uses a concurrent tri-color mark-and-sweep algorithm. It works in phases: 1) Mark Setup - stops the world briefly and enables write barriers, 2) Marking - concurrent phase where it traces from roots marking reachable objects, 3) Mark Termination - stops the world to finish marking, and 4) Sweeping - concurrent phase that reclaims unmarked memory. The tri-color scheme uses white (potentially garbage), gray (being scanned), and black (reachable) sets to manage concurrent collection safely."}}

This is configured via the AGENT_API_PORT environment variable in your .env file. You can change this by setting AGENT_API_PORT=<your_port> in the .env file. The API uses the go-restful framework and supports OpenAPI documentation. It includes endpoints for querying, streaming responses, and admin operations like cache management. Make sure the port isn't already in use by another service, and if you're running in Docker, remember to map the port in your docker-compose.yml file."}}

Claude Haiku (3) is faster and cheaper but less capable. Query rewriting is a relatively simple task.","answer":"For query rewriting, Claude Haiku is the better choice. Query rewriting is a focused task that doesn't require Sonnet's advanced reasoning capabilities. Haiku provides ~500ms latency (vs Sonnet's ~2s), costs significantly less, and performs well for this structured transformation task. The KG agent already uses this pattern - Haiku for fast operations like validation and rewriting, Sonnet for complex reasoning with retrieved context."}}

Setup involves running docker-compose, running migrations, and ingesting documents.","answer":"You need to use PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension. The database stores document chunks with their embeddings for semantic search."}}

The search API and agent API are separate services. To fix this: 1) cd into kg-agent directory, 2) Run 'docker-compose up -d' to start PostgreSQL and Redis, 3) In one terminal run 'go run cmd/search/main.go' to start the search API on port 8082, 4) In another terminal run 'go run cmd/agent/main.go' for the agent API. Verify the search API is running with 'curl http://localhost:8082/api/v1/health'."}}
{"event_id":"evt-rel-015","event_type":"agent_response","agent":{"name":"kg-agent","type":"rag","version":"1.0.0"},"interaction":{"user_query":"What is retrieval augmented generation?","context":"RAG is a technique that combines retrieval and generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them to ground LLM responses.","answer":"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that enhances language model responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG first searches for pertinent documents, then provides them as context to the LLM. This reduces hallucinations, enables up-to-date information, and grounds responses in verifiable sources. The KG agent is a RAG system - it searches the vector database for relevant chunks, then passes them to Claude along with the user's query."}}
{"event_id":"evt-rel-016","event_type":"agent_response","agent":{"name":"kg-agent","type":"rag","version":"1.0.0"},"interaction":{"user_query":"How do I cache it?","context":"Previous conversation was about caching Docker images to speed up builds. User asked about layer caching strategies.","answer":"The KG agent implements Redis-based search result caching with SHA256-keyed cache and 30-minute TTL. When the same query is executed, it returns cached results in ~50ms instead of ~500ms. You can clear the cache using the POST /api/v1/admin/cache/clear endpoint."}}

Additionally, there are three heuristic prechecks (LengthChecker, OverlapChecker, FormatChecker) that run before the LLM judges to provide early-exit optimization."}}

{"event_id":"evt-rel-019","event_type":"agent_response","agent":{"name":"kg-agent","type":"rag","version":"1.0.0"},"interaction":{"user_query":"What do you mean by 'hybrid search'?","context":"Previous message mentioned that the search API uses hybrid search. User wants clarification on this term.","answer":"Hybrid search in the KG agent combines two search methods: 1) Semantic search - uses pgvector cosine similarity on embeddings to find documents with similar meaning, and 2) Keyword search - uses PostgreSQL's full-text search (tsvector) for exact term matches. Results from both methods are merged using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), which balances semantic understanding with keyword precision. This gives better results than either method alone - semantic search handles synonyms and concepts, while keyword search catches specific terms."}}

No retrieved context applies to restaurant recommendations.","answer":"I'm designed to help with technical questions about Go programming and our RAG agent system. However, you might want to try using Google Maps or Yelp to find Italian restaurants in your area."}}
